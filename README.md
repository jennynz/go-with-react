# Go with React

An interactive Go board built using React in ES2015.

This project was spun off from [Facebook's introductory React tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) on building a [Tic-Tac-Toe board](https://codepen.io/ericnakagawa/pen/ALxakj).

## To Do
- ~~Set up React app and figure out how the code deployment pipeline works.~~
- ~~Add in the Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial code and make sure it's all plugged in and working.~~
- ~~Instead of noughts and crosses, add stones.~~
- Turn the tic-tac-toe board into a 19x19 Go board.
- Get the stones to place themselves at the intersections of the grid rather than inside the squares.
- Improve UI
  - Better layout on page
  - Nicer board, nicer stones

## Would-Be-Nice
- Scroll through moves in a slider format rather than list.
- Can change the size of the board (9x9, 13x13 etc.).
- Timer for each player, able to be customised.
- Change theme/skin

## If it had a backend
- Can connect with other players online, maybe through "rooms" or a unique link (check out [Spyfall](https://github.com/evanbrumley/spyfall))
- User authentication
  - View history of past games
  - Badges, gamification
